This directory contains information on how to make a message.

A message consists of three parts:

The sender:

    This is where the message is being sent from. The sender is stored as an IP address in between two "<f>".

The receiver:

    This where the message is being sent to. The receiver is stored as an IP address in between two "<t>".

The timestamp:

    This is the time at which the message was sent. The timestamp is formatted as Year_Month_Day_Hour_Min_Sec_MicroSec.



Some keys are reserved.

    <t>     this indicates the start and finish of the receiver IP address
    <f>     this indicates the start and finish of the sender IP address
    <s>     this indicates the start and finish of the timestamp IP address
